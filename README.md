## Oh My Link!!
Oh my link is a simple web extension ( compatible in both firefox and chrome ) that will let you open a url from your machine's web browser to your smart phone, just by scanning the QR code.

## Motivation
I use different browsers in my office laptop and personal laptop(Chrome and Mozilla to be concise).  Some of the times if I have to open the same website on my mobile phone, I have to struggle alot in copying each and every character correctly in my phone. (I use browser sync for chrome bdw, because I have chrome installed in my phone but what to do for mozilla?). I simply created an extension which will generate QR code for the current url and one can simply scan it and open it on their phone. Simple!

## Tech/framework used
This project is purely based on HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
